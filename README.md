Energy Blockchain Workflow Demo

/A consensus system for energy markets/

## Storyline
http://docs.stromdao.de/pdf/en_consensus_system.pdf

Transactions a number of human processes and institutions are paid to establish trust. Blockchain technology replaces these institutions, making it possible to conduct transactions without a third party intermediary. 

With the StromDAO BusinessObject utilities get out of a intermediary role beeing a process orchestration (without additional value )and open the market to new products and services. This is done by pushing consens required activities into a general space provided by a blockchain and let those activities executed by the community.

Within the next 10 years the number of actors on the market will explode from currently 1.500 players in Germany to 1.5 Million. Small scale peers require the market processes to follow a common consens mechanism.

Instead of developing proprietary platforms, StromDAO sees an opportunity for energy market participants to jointly fund and develop a single environment for the global energy sector, national grids and local communities. Consens is universal.
